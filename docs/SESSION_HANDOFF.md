# Session Handoff — Empire of Companies

Last updated: 2026-11-06

## Mission
Continue the browser-first 3D office/company management game:
https://github.com/ijoolaie/empire-of-companies

## Non-negotiable product decisions
- Babylon.js + TypeScript + Vite.
- Persian/English and RTL/LTR.
- Browser first; PWA next; Android via Capacitor later.
- Procedural art; do not require Blender or paid assets.
- Local-only game saves. Supabase is identity-only, not cloud save/sync.
- Do not merge PRs without explicit user approval.
- User asked for practical execution and verified status, not schedules.

## Repository state
- Local path: `C:\Users\Ali\local-mcp-bridge\workspaces\empire-of-companies`.
- Baseline main commit: `7914290` (PR #2 merged).
- Current branch: `feat/p4-office-environment`.
- Latest committed remote head before current local furniture slice: `be605f045c57b21bff0fdf3aad52f3ae2ef8b4a4`; new furniture slice is locally validated and awaiting commit/push.
- PR #3: open, Draft, mergeable; CI run #88 passed for `be605f0`. Current local changes still need their own CI run. PR URL: https://github.com/ijoolaie/empire-of-companies/pull/3.

## Current implementation
- Core economy, desk placement, hiring, upgrades, local persistence and bounded offline earnings.
- Progression schema v4, XP/levels, three ordered objectives, tutorial and accessible progression dialog.
- Procedural seated workers with deterministic appearance variants, three idle poses and arrival walking.
- Desk equipment: monitor stand/base, keyboard and mouse.
- Office-shell slice: five wall segments, open 2.5-unit entrance, entrance trim/threshold/sign, three framed rear windows, three ceiling panels, three warm point lights and baseboards. Current local addition: bookcase/books, wall clock and framed wall art.
- Entrance remains open; no door mesh blocks the existing arrival corridor.
- Canvas diagnostics: `data-office-wall-segment-count`, `data-office-window-count`, `data-office-entrance-part-count`, `data-office-light-count`, `data-office-furniture-count`.

## Verification
- Unit tests: 22/22 passed.
- Production build: passed; 466 modules, main bundle 1,155.97 kB minified / 286.18 kB gzip. Existing >500 kB Vite warning remains.
- Browser tests: 19/19 passed, including the furniture-detail assertion.
- Diff whitespace check: passed.
- Automated office-shell mesh/light counts passed.
- Visual review completed from headless Chromium/SwiftShader captures: desktop 900×600, mobile 390×844, and alternate orbit views at both sizes. No obvious geometry clipping or entrance blockage was seen; browser page errors were absent. This does not replace real-device GPU review.
- GitHub Actions run #88 passed for `be605f0`. The current local furniture slice passes 22 unit tests, build and 19 browser tests; its CI is pending push.

## Exact next steps
1. Review PR #3; it is intentionally Draft and must not be merged without explicit approval.
2. Continue P4 with richer office furniture and environmental polish, maintaining desktop/mobile and alternate-angle checks.
3. Perform real-device GPU review when a physical test environment is available.
4. Keep business simulation, Supabase Auth, PWA and Android work in their planned phases.
