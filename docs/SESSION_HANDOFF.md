# Session Handoff — Empire of Companies

Last updated: 2026-11-06

## Mission
Continue the browser-first 3D office/company management game:
https://github.com/ijoolaie/empire-of-companies

## Non-negotiable product decisions
- Babylon.js + TypeScript + Vite.
- Persian/English and RTL/LTR.
- Browser first; PWA next; Android via Capacitor later.
- Procedural art; do not require Blender or paid assets.
- Local-only game saves. Supabase is identity-only, not cloud save/sync.
- Do not merge PRs without explicit user approval.
- User asked for practical execution and verified status, not schedules.

## Repository state
- Local path: `C:\Users\Ali\local-mcp-bridge\workspaces\empire-of-companies`.
- Baseline main commit: `7914290` (PR #2 merged).
- Current branch: `feat/p4-office-environment`.
- Latest pushed head: `72513343dc169710dd140c8c234ec56dd9ccc7ef` (`feat: refine procedural employee appearance`). CI run #96 passed build, unit tests and browser regression: https://github.com/ijoolaie/empire-of-companies/actions/runs/42245316364.
- Local branch was clean and synced at this head before the next worker-detail slice.
- PR #3 remains open, Draft and unmerged. PR URL: https://github.com/ijoolaie/empire-of-companies/pull/3.

## Current implementation
- Core economy, desk placement, hiring, upgrades, local persistence and bounded offline earnings.
- Progression schema v4, XP/levels, three ordered objectives, tutorial and accessible progression dialog.
- Procedural seated workers with deterministic appearance variants, three idle poses and arrival walking. Each worker now has a small color-varied necktie; regression coverage checks per-worker mesh counts and shared material reuse.
- Desk equipment: monitor stand/base, keyboard and mouse.
- Office-shell slice: five wall segments, open 2.5-unit entrance, entrance trim/threshold/sign, three framed rear windows, three ceiling panels, three warm point lights and baseboards. Added bookcase/books, wall clock, framed wall art, cork notice board with three pinned notes, a five-mesh waiting bench against the left wall, per-desk paper/mug/pen accessories and under-desk drawer units, a three-bar entrance emblem and a near-flush entry mat with trim.
- Entrance remains open; no door mesh blocks the existing arrival corridor.
- Canvas diagnostics: `data-office-wall-segment-count`, `data-office-window-count`, `data-office-entrance-part-count`, `data-office-light-count`, `data-office-furniture-count`, `data-office-notice-board-mesh-count`, `data-office-waiting-area-mesh-count`, `data-desk-accessory-mesh-count`, `data-desk-storage-mesh-count`.

## Verification
- Latest pushed head `2740251` passed GitHub Actions run #96 (build, unit tests and browser regression): https://github.com/ijoolaie/empire-of-companies/actions/runs/42245316364.
- Local verification for that head: unit tests 22/22, production build passed (1,159.92 kB minified / 287.20 kB gzip; existing >500 kB Vite warning), browser tests 19/19, diff check passed.
- Worker-detail slice adds one color-varied necktie mesh per worker, reusing four cached materials across appearance variants. Local verification: unit tests 22/22, build passed (1,160.29 kB minified / 287.25 kB gzip; existing Vite chunk warning), browser tests 19/19, diff check passed. Commit `7251334`; this slice is committed and pushed.
- Diff whitespace check: passed.
- Automated office-shell mesh/light counts passed, including 8 notice-board meshes, 9 entrance-detail meshes and 9 desk-accessory meshes across the three-desk fixture.
- Visual review completed from headless Chromium/SwiftShader captures: desktop 900×600, mobile 390×844, and alternate orbit views at both sizes. No obvious geometry clipping or entrance blockage was seen; browser page errors were absent. This does not replace real-device GPU review.
- GitHub Actions run #95 for pushed head `9915b33` passed all steps including browser regression: https://github.com/ijoolaie/empire-of-companies/actions/runs/42242077806.
- Latest local drawer-storage validation: unit tests 22/22, build passed (1,159.92 kB minified / 287.20 kB gzip; existing Vite chunk warning), browser tests 19/19, diff check passed.
- Waiting-bench local validation: unit tests 22/22, build passed, browser tests 19/19, diff check passed. The local build bundle is 1,159.47 kB minified / 287.11 kB gzip; existing Vite chunk warning remains.

## Exact next steps
1. Review PR #3; it is intentionally Draft and must not be merged without explicit approval.
2. Continue P4 with richer office furniture and environmental polish, maintaining desktop/mobile and alternate-angle checks.
3. Perform real-device GPU review when a physical test environment is available.
4. Keep business simulation, Supabase Auth, PWA and Android work in their planned phases.
